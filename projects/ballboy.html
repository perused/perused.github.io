    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p class="pd">Ballboy, the hero, and their companion, a purple square known as Squarecat, set out to conquer a mario-esque world. Little do they know that the real focus of the project was on design patterns.</p>
  
    <p class="pd">The codebase includes the following design patterns: factories for all entities, strategies for behaviour and collision, memento for saving and loading as well as the observer pattern for displaying the scores on screen. The entire level is configurable by a JSON file containing the location and appearance of the ballboy, enemies and platforms. Multiple levels exist and transitions exist between them. The use of design patterns has made the game easily extensible for adding new features and modifying the JSON configuration file. The whole game play through can be viewed <a class="project-hyperlink" href="https://youtu.be/wpyTRp903Io" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
