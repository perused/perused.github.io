    <h1>Connect Four Bot</h1>

    <p class="pd">I decided to have a competition with two other friends to design and implement the best Connect Four bot. After implementation, we would have our bots play each other for the ultimate battle off to determine who had the best bot. This project can be viewed on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/perused/connect-four-bot/tree/bot" target="_blank">here</a>, where my bot is on branch bot.</p>

    <p class="pd">The bots are still in development, but the victor will be announced here following the ultimate showdown.</p>
